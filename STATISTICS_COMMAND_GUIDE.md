# Attendance Statistics Command System

## Overview

This system implements a comprehensive `/calculate-stats` command interface for generating detailed attendance statistics with section-specific filtering capabilities.

## Database Structure Analysis

The system works with these key tables:

### Tables
- **attendances**: Core attendance records with AM/PM time tracking
- **students**: Student information linked to sections and teachers  
- **sections**: Class sections with time boundaries and teacher assignments
- **users**: Teachers with section relationships
- **semesters**: Academic periods with time boundaries

### Key Relationships
- Students belong to sections
- Sections can have multiple teachers (many-to-many via section_teacher table)
- Attendances track student presence with detailed time patterns
- Each attendance record includes AM/PM time slots and status tracking

## Command Interface

### Basic Syntax
```
/calculate-stats [period] [section] [options]
```

### Parameters

#### Period Options
- `daily` - Today's statistics
- `weekly` - Current week analysis  
- `monthly` - Current month metrics
- `semester` - Full semester analytics
- `custom` - User-defined date range

#### Section Options
- `auto` - Auto-detect teacher's sections (defaults to first if multiple)
- `all` - Analyze all teacher's assigned sections
- `{section_name}` - Specific section (e.g., "Grade-10-A")

#### Options Flags
- `--charts` - Include visualization data
- `--detailed` - Comprehensive analysis
- `--cross-section` - Compare between sections (multi-section only)

### Example Commands
```bash
# Basic monthly analysis for auto-detected section
/calculate-stats monthly auto --charts

# Compare all sections with detailed analysis
/calculate-stats weekly all --detailed --cross-section

# Specific section daily report
/calculate-stats daily Grade-10-A --charts --detailed

# Custom date range for all sections
/calculate-stats custom all --charts
```

## Calculated Metrics

### 1. Daily Attendance Metrics
- **Daily Attendance Rate (%)** = (Present Students / Total Students) × 100
- **Absenteeism Rate (%)** = (Total Absences / Possible Attendance Days) × 100  
- **Late Arrival Rate (%)** = (Late Students / Total Students) × 100

### 2. Periodic Analysis
- **Average Daily Attendance** = Total Daily Attendance / School Days
- **Enrollment Percentage** = Current Enrollment vs. Baseline
- **Monthly Attendance Percentage** = Average Daily / Current Enrollment

### 3. Time Pattern Analysis
- **Late Comers**: Students arriving after section's designated time
- **Early Leavers**: Students leaving before section's end time
- **Average Arrival/Departure Times**: Statistical timing analysis
- **Punctuality Rate**: On-time arrival percentage

### 4. Absence Pattern Analysis
- **Total Absences**: Count across reporting period
- **Chronic Absentees**: Students with >10% absence rate
- **Day-of-Week Patterns**: Absence trends by weekday
- **Individual Student Absence Rates**

### 5. Statistical Visualizations
- **Pie Charts**: Absentees by period (7-day, monthly)
- **Trend Analysis**: Daily attendance patterns over time
- **Late Comer Tracking**: Punctuality trend analysis

## Implementation Details

### Key Query Patterns

#### Attendance Rate Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN time_in_am IS NOT NULL OR time_in_pm IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as present,
    COUNT(*) as total
FROM attendances 
WHERE student_id IN (section_student_ids)
AND date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
```

#### Late Arrival Detection
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as late_count
FROM attendances a
JOIN sections s ON a.student_id IN (s.student_ids)
WHERE a.time_in_am > s.am_time_in_start
AND a.date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
```

#### Chronic Absenteeism Identification
```sql
SELECT student_id, 
    COUNT(*) as total_days,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN time_in_am IS NULL AND time_in_pm IS NULL THEN 1 END) as absent_days,
    (absent_days / total_days * 100) as absence_rate
FROM attendances
WHERE student_id IN (section_student_ids)
GROUP BY student_id
HAVING absence_rate > 10
```

### Section Detection Logic
```php
if (teacher.sections.length === 1) {
    defaultSection = teacher.sections[0];
} else if (teacher.sections.length > 1 && !sectionParam) {
    // Default to first section for auto mode
    defaultSection = teacher.sections[0];
} else if (sectionParam === "all") {
    processAllSections = true;
}
```

## Usage in Application

### Web Interface
The statistics page now includes a command interface where teachers can:

1. Select analysis period (daily/weekly/monthly/semester/custom)
2. Choose section scope (auto/all/specific section)  
3. Enable optional features (charts/detailed/cross-section)
4. View real-time command generation
5. Execute analysis and view formatted results

### API Integration
```javascript
fetch('/teacher/analytics/calculate-stats', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        period: 'monthly',
        section: 'Grade-10-A', 
        options: ['charts', 'detailed']
    })
})
```

### Error Handling
- Invalid section names return descriptive errors
- Missing data periods provide fallback calculations  
- Database connection issues are gracefully handled
- Insufficient data scenarios include helpful messages
